# Elevator algorithms
In this project I am simulating two elevator algorithms. The first one is a naive system where the elevator only goes up and down from the top to the bottom, and stops at every floor. <br>
I am going to design a better, more efficient algoritm that reduces average wait time in the building. <br>
I have animated the system using Tkinter in Python.
